Happy holidays everyone! 

This is just a small reminder that we use the
[University's official Github organization](http://github.com/uit-no) to version
control this website. If you want to have a look, visit our 
[cs-lunch repository](http://github.com/uit-no/cs-lunch)! 

Also, if you're a Ph.  D. student at the department and want to contribute, send
me or Einar an e-mail.
