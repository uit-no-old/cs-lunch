Next up in the seminar series is [Robert Pettersen](http://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=197818&p_dimension_id=88138)
giving a talk about reducing latency for mobile .NET applications that interact
with clouddatabase services. 

The CS-Lunch is at Lille Aud. Realfagbygget on May
13., 12:15 - 13:00. You'll need to sign up [here](http://uit.no/om/enhet/aktuelt/arrangement?p_document_id=417231&p_dimension_id=88138). 

#### Abstract

We demonstrate a practical way to reduce latency for mobile .NET applications
that interact with cloud database services.

We provide a programming abstraction for location-independent code, which has
the potential to execute either locally or at a satellite execution environment
in the cloud, in close proximity to the database service. This preserves a
programmatic style of database access, and maintains a simple deployment model,
but allows applications to offload latency-sensitive code to the cloud.

Our evaluation shows that this approach can significantly improve the response
time for applications that execute dependent queries, and that the required
cloud-side resources are modest.
