**Kvik: Interactive exploration of genomic data from the NOWAC postgenome biobank**

Bjørn Fjukstad, Karina Standahl Olsen, Mie Jareid, Eiliv Lund, Lars Ailo Bongo

*Abstract*

We have developed Kvik, a system for interactive exploration of genomic
data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) postgenome
biobank. The goal of the NOWAC study is to understand the dynamics
of carcinogenesis through multi-level functional analyses of transcriptomics
and epigenetics using blood and tissue samples. Kvik provides a tool for
exploring gene expression data, incorporating both statistical analysis and
interactive visualizations in a single system. The tool is open-sourced at
[github.com/fjukstad/kvik](http://github.com/fjukstad/kvik).
