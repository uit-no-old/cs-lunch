presenting *DeltaTree*. The CS-Lunch is at Lille Aud. Realfagbygget on March
18., 12:15 - 13:00. You'll need to sign up [here](http://uit.no/tavla/artikkel/409906/computer_science_lunch_3).

<h4> Abstract </h4> 
DeltaTree, a practical locality-aware concurrent search tree that integrates
both locality-optimization techniques from vEB-based trees, and
concurrency-optimization techniques from non-blocking and highly-concurrent
search trees. As a result, DeltaTree minimizes data transfer from memory to CPU
while supporting high concurrency. DeltaTree is a k-ary leaf-oriented tree of
DeltaNodes where each DeltaNode is a fixed size tree-container with the van Emde
Boas layout. Our experimental evaluation using the recent implementation of
non-blocking binary search trees, highly concurrent B-trees, conventional vEB
trees, as well as the concurrent AVL trees, red-black trees, and speculation
friendly trees from the Synchrobench benchmark shows that DeltaTree are up to
140% faster than the other trees on commodity Intel high performance computing
(HPC) platforms. On commodity ARM embedded platforms, DeltaTree are up to 100%
faster than the other trees."
