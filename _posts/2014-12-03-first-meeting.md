On December 3. 2014 we had our first planning meeting for the CS-lunch seminar
series. 7 of the Ph. D. Students from the department attended and we decided on
the format of the CS-lunch for 2015. The department had bought in *pepperkaker*
for the hungry students as well, thanks! 


# Agenda

Before the meeting we had the following set up on the agenda: 

- What should we present / talk about? 
- Who should present? 
- Who should attend? 
- How often? 
- Website? Facebook? 
- Other

# Discussion 
From the discussion we agreed that the CS-lunch should follow the format of the
previous lunch series, with some modifications. The Ph. D. Students are required
to present work that will be, or has been, presented at a conference or
published in a journal. However we will open up for presentations about ongioing
work that has not been published yet. In addition to inviting the academic staff
at the department we also wish to include undergraduate students! We want the
CS-lunches to be an open and inviting arena where both students and staff can
share ideas and experiences across the research groups. 

To begin with we are hosting one CS-lunch per month, with the opportunity to
host additional lunches if we wish to. The lunches should fit into a 45-minute
timeslot, with 30 minutes presentations and 15 minutes for discussion and
feedback. 

On a more technical note, we are going to keep an updated webpage at
[lunch.cs.uit.no](http://lunch.cs.uit.no) and try to promote the seminar series
through a Facebook-page as well. 

In addition to the CS-lunch seminar we also wish to organize social
get-togethers. On the evening after the first CS-lunch we will organize a get to
gether in the city where we can get some refreshments and snacks!
