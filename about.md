The CS-lunch is for PhD students, and it is established for the presentations of
accepted conference and journal papers to the other students and the staff
at the department. Usually such a presentation will be done before the actual
conference presentation. This will give the presenter valuable feedback. 

The CS-lunch at the department is an important part of the PhD studies.  These
events are an opportunity to present your research results, to participate in
research discussion, to provide arguments (and counter-arguments), and to share
your knowledge (and questions).  You should not miss that opportunity, and it
should be high on your priority list (only a few acceptable arguments to not
participate exits)
