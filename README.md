# CS-lunch
This is the [cs-lunch](http://lunch.cs.uit.no) website. It uses
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build and generate the page from the
markdown files here and there. If you push changes to the
[deployment](https://github.com/uit-no/cs-lunch/tree/deployment) branch Github
and webhooks will take care of publishing it on the webpage itself. 

# About

University of Tromsø. Ph. D. students at the department will present their
accepted conference and journal papers for both academic staff and students. For
